# Hotel Booking System

The Hotel Booking System is a Python-based program that allows users to book rooms in different hotels. This system is implemented using SQLAlchemy and a SQLite database to store hotel and room information.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can sign in with their email and passkey to access the system.

- Hotel selection: Users can select a hotel based on its address and view available rooms in that hotel.

- Room booking: Users can book available rooms in the selected hotel, and the system ensures that a room cannot be double-booked.

- Python 3.x
